        1. Upon the first day of the week,
        Our Savior came forth from the grave,
        He died, was buried, then arose,
        To reign, to triumph, and to save!
        CHORUS
        Though others may forsake the Lord,
        Yet, we are here Thy truth to seek;
        Thy holy presence comforts us,
        Upon the first day of the week.

        1. Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine!
        Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine!
        Heir of salvation, purchase of God,
        Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood.
        CHORUS
        This is my story, this is my song,
        Praising my Savior all the day long;
        This is my story, this is my song,
        Praising my Savior all the day long.

        1. Amazing grace, how sweet the sound,
        That saved a wretch like me!
        I once was lost, but now am found,
        Was blind, but now I see.
        2. 'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
        And grace my fears relieved;
        How precious did that grace appear
        The hour I first believed.
